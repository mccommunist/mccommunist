While many of our users are design professionals, a larger percentage are not. For these non-designers, even simple image edits like resizing a photo, adding text or uploading a logo can be time-consuming distractions that require specialized software. By building a simple image editor into the site experience, we made it easier to use our images regardless of a user's skill level.</p>		<p>From weighing in on what to call it (unless there's going to be a heavy marketing push, I'll always advocate for a descriptive name), to writing single word labels that helped users understand the features at a glance, to creating a landing page to help launch the product, I helped contribute to a significant new feature that improved engagement by addressing a real user need.</p>		</div>   </section>  </div>  </body></html>
