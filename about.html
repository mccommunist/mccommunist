I've been called a web editor, content specialist, copywriter and UX writer at different points in my career, but what I'm most proud of is being called in to help create useful, usable content that delights users and accomplishes business goals.</p>		<p>From creating clear and helpful error messages to crafting a complex content strategies for major product launches, I help users by providing them the right information at the right time. Collaborating closely with research, product and customer service teams keeps my work grounded in a deeply empathetic understanding of our users.</p>		<p>For the past 6 years, I’ve been lucky to do this work with an amazing team at iStock by Getty Images. When I’m not busy helping users discover the world’s best stock photography, there’s a good chance I’m writing a column for Uppercase Magazine or an essay for my own enjoyment. In the unlikely event of free time, you’ll find me working through a stack of books on the bedside table.</p>				</div>   </section>  </div>  </body></html>
